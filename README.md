# Allons-y!

My name is Jacob Emerick. I am a web developer who focuses on practical, responsible implementation. Also, I enjoy hiking and think bow ties are cool.

I work on the [Shutterstock API](https://www.shutterstock.com/developers/) during the week and explore the mountains of Arizona on the weekend. Also have a shiver of children and a fantastical [wife](https://www.facebook.com/klemerick85). I [blog](https://blog.jacobemerick.com/) too.

These repos are a mixed bag of PHP, Node, and other things. Enjoy!
